# ✅ Platform Independence - Complete!

Your Devignite CV Platform is now **100% independent** from Replit and can be deployed to any hosting platform.

## 🎯 What Changed

### 1. **Vite Build System** ✅
- **Before:** Replit plugins always loaded (causing build failures elsewhere)
- **After:** Replit plugins ONLY load in Replit dev environment
- **Result:** Clean production builds work everywhere

### 2. **Email Service (Resend)** ✅
- **Before:** Only worked with Replit connector
- **After:** Works with direct API key OR Replit connector
- **Result:** Deploy anywhere with your own Resend API key

### 3. **Application URLs** ✅
- **Before:** Hardcoded `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN`
- **After:** Generic `APP_URL` with smart fallbacks
- **Result:** Works on any domain (Render, Railway, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

## 🔧 New Environment Variables for External Deployment

When deploying outside Replit, add these **3 new variables**:

```env
# 1. Your deployment URL
APP_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com

# 2. Direct Resend API key (get from resend.com)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key

# 3. Email address to send from
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

All other environment variables remain the same!

## 🚀 Deployment is Now Simple

### Before Independence:
```
❌ Only works on Replit
❌ Can't deploy to Render/Railway/Vercel
❌ Email only works with Replit connector
❌ Vite build fails on other platforms
```

### After Independence:
```
✅ Deploy to ANY platform
✅ Use your own Resend API key
✅ Standard environment variables
✅ Clean builds everywhere
✅ STILL works perfectly in Replit
```
